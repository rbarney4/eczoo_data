physical: matrices
logical: points

name: 'Spacetime block code (STBC)'
short_name: 'STBC'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/49.730453}'

description: 'In a space-time block code \(n\) spatially separated channels transmit symbols in \(T\) time slots. These symbols can be arranged in a \(T\times n\) matrix where the columns correspond to the channels and the rows correspond to the time slots. The codewords \(\{X\}\) are \(T\times n\) matrices such that the codeword difference matrices have rank \(n\) and \(\min_{X\neq 0}\det(XX^*)\) is maximized.'

protection: 'Provides protection against errors due to thermal noise and destructive interference arising from traversing an environment with scattering, reflection, and/or refraction.'
